Of all the music that reached farthest into heaven, it is the beating of a loving heart.
Without music, life would be a mistake
One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain
Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent
And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man
And, in the end The love you take is equal to the love you make
People haven't always been there for me but music always has
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness
Some people have lives; some people have music.
If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music
